Notes on the Bach solo Violin Partitas & Sonatas and the solo 'Cello Sonatas

A number of movements have been encoded using non-monophonic
formats in order to simplify the innumerable double-, triple-,
and quadruple-stops.

The following movements have been encoded in four-voice format:

	1. 'Sarabande' from the Violin Partita No. 1

	2. 'Tempo di Borea' from the Violin Partita No. 1

	3. 'Fuga' from the Violin Sonata No. 1

	4. 'Fuga' from the Violin Sonata No. 2

The following movements have been encoded in two-voice format:

	1. The 'Double' for the 'Tempo di Borea' from the Violin
	   Partita No. 1 has been encoded using a two-voice format
	   in order to better accommodate material in bars 20 through
	   24.

	2. 'Preludio' from the Violin Partita No. 3

=============
GENERAL NOTES
=============

The full collection of Opus 8 was published by Michel-Charles Le Cene
in Amsterdam in 1725 under the title "Il Cimento dell'armonia e
dell'inventione" (The Contest of Harmony and Invention).  It was
dedicated by Vivaldi to the Bohemian Count Wenceslas, Count of Morzin,
an advisor to the Austrian Emperor Charles Vi.

The accompanying data files form the electronic companion to the
critical edition edited by Dr. Eleanor Selfridge-Field and published
by Dover Publications, New York.

Machine transcription, proof reading, and proof listening was done by
Steven Rasmussen under the editorial supervision of Dr. Selfridge-Field.
Translation to the Humdrum **kern format and preparation of the
variant source data was carried out by Dr. David Huron.  Original music
entry and editing was done using the "Tenx" facilities designed and
implemented by Dr. Walter B. Hewlett.

For permission to consult its holdings, we gratefully acknowledge
the cooperation of the Saechsische Landesbibliotek, Dresden, Germany;
the Biblioteca Nazionale Universitaria, Turino, Italy; and the Henry
Watson Music Library, Manchester, United Kingdom.

A detailed description of the **kern representation format is given in
the accompanying file "kern_hlp.txt".

A detailed description of how to access the variant manuscripts is
given in the accompanying file "variants.txt".

The accompanying files are protected by copyright and are distributed by
license only.  Refer to the accompanying license statement and original
license agreement for details.

============
INSTALLATION
============

This release of the "Vivaldi Twelve Violin Concertos" is distributed
on two DOS-format 1.44 megabtye disks.  All of the files on these disks
contain raw ASCII (text) data only;  the data are not compressed.

Depending on the installation platform and user requirements, you will
need to install from EITHER disk #1 OR disk #2 OR BOTH disks #1 and #2.

DISK #1 contains the critical edition prepared by Dr. Eleanor Selfridge-
        Field.  The data on this disk corresponds precisely with the
        printed Dover volume of the Selfridge-Field edition.  You can
        install the files from this disk on any system.

DISK #2 provides Integrated Source Files from which five different sources
        may be reconstructed:  (1) the Selfridge-Field critical edition
        (same as Disk #1), (2) the Amsterdam prints, (3) the Dresden
        manuscripts, (4) the Manchester part-books, and (5) the Turin
        autographs.  The enclosed "edition" command can be used in
        conjunction with the files on disk #2 to reconstruct any or all of
        these sources.  In order to access the variants provided on disk #2,
        you must have installed a copy of the Humdrum Toolkit.  (See below
        for information about how to acquire Humdrum.)  The "edition"
        command itself uses Humdrum utilities to extract a user-specified
        source from the integrated source files.  You can install files
        from this disk on any system that supports the Humdrum Toolkit.

To install the data, simply copy the contents of the appropriate disk(s)
to your hard drive:

 * If you do not use the Humdrum Toolkit, simply copy the contents of
   disk #1.  This will give you access to the Selfridge-Field Critical
   Edition.

 * If you have the Humdrum Toolkit, you may copy EITHER disk #1 or
   disk #2 or BOTH disks.  If you wish to have access only to the
   Selfridge-Field edition, simply copy disk #1 to your hard drive.  If
   you wish to have access to one of more of the variant sources, copy
   disk #2 to your hard drive.  If you would like to have access to both
   the variant sources and would like to have an independent copy of the
   Selfridge-Field edition -- without having to generate them using the
   "edition" command, copy both disks #1 and #2 to your hard drive.

CRITICAL EDITION INSTALLATION
*****************************

In order to install the Selfridge-Field critical edition, simply copy all of
the files on Disk #1 into an appropriate directory on your hard drive.

(1) Move to a directory where you would like to install the database.
    (Recommended: \scores\vivaldi\     OR ~/scores/vivaldi on Unix)

(2) Insert the first distribution disk into an appropriate floppy disk drive.

    Copy all of the files from the distribution disk into the appropriate
    directory.  Assuming that the distribution disk is located in the A: drive,
    and that you wish to copy the files to the directory named \scores\vivaldi,
    the appropriate DOS or OS/2 command is:

         copy a: \scores\vivaldi

    On Unix systems, use the command:

         cp a:* ~/scores/vivaldi

VARIANT SOURCES INSTALLATION
****************************

In order to install the variant sources for Opus 8, simply copy all of the
files on Disk #2 into an appropriate directory on your hard drive.

(1) Move to a directory where you would like to install the database.
    (Recommended: \scores\vivaldi\     OR ~/scores/vivaldi on Unix)

(2) Insert the second distribution disk into an appropriate floppy disk drive.

    Copy all of the files from the distribution disk into the appropriate
    directory.  Assuming that the distribution disk is located in the A: drive,
    and that you wish to copy the files to the directory named \scores\vivaldi,
    the appropriate DOS or OS/2 command is:

         copy a: \scores\vivaldi

    On Unix systems, use the command:

         cp a:* ~/scores/vivaldi

CRITICAL EDITION AND SOURCES INSTALLATION
*****************************************

The Selfridge-Field edition can be generated from the integrated sources files.
However, you may find it convenient to install the critical edition directly
rather than manually generating the files from the integrated source files.
You can install both as follows:

(1) Move to a directory where you would like to install the critical edition.
    (Recommended: \scores\vivaldi\critical.ed OR ~/scores/vivaldi/critical.ed on Unix)

(2) Insert the first distribution disk into an appropriate floppy disk drive.

    Copy all of the files from Disk #1 into the appropriate directory.  Assuming
    that the distribution disk is located in the A: drive, and that you wish to
    copy the files to the directory named \scores\vivaldi, the appropriate DOS or
    OS/2 command is:

         copy a: \scores\vivaldi\critical.ed

    On Unix systems, use the command:

         cp a:* ~/scores/vivaldi/critical.ed

(3) Move to a directory where you would like to install the source files.
    (Recommended: \scores\vivaldi\sources OR ~/scores/vivaldi/sources on Unix)

(4) Insert the second distribution disk into an appropriate floppy disk drive.

    Copy all of the files from the distribution disk into the appropriate
    directory.  Assuming that the distribution disk is located in the A: drive,
    and that you wish to copy the files to the directory named \scores\vivaldi,
    the appropriate DOS or OS/2 command is:

         copy a: \scores\vivaldi\sources

    On Unix systems, use the command:

         cp a:* ~/scores/vivaldi/sources

If you are using the Humdrum Toolkit and wish to have access to the variant
sources, continue with PART TWO (see below) of the installation procedure.

THE "EDITION" AND "MSOURCE" COMMANDS
************************************

If you have installed the Integrated Source Files (from Disk #2) you
will be able to make use of the "edition" and "msource" commands.
The "edition" command allows you to generate any given musical
source for a specified movement.  The "msource" command allows you
to automatically generate all movements derived from a given manuscript
source.  Both commands are described below.

    N.B. The "edition" and "msource" commands will only run on systems
    providing a Unix-like shell -- such as Linux, DOS or Windows running
    MKS, or Apple systems running Mach 10, A/UX, or mklinux.  In addition,
    the Humdrum Toolkit must also be installed.

First, we need to ensure that the commands are executable on your
platform.

(1) Change directories to the location where you installed the files
    from Disk #2.

(2) On DOS and OS/2 systems, make the "edition.ksh" and "msource.ksh"
    scripts executable by typing the following command:

         chmod +x edition.ksh msource.ksh

(3) On UNIX systems, make the "edition" and "msource" scripts executable
    by typing the following commands:

         mv edition.ksh edition
         mv msource.ksh msource
         chmod +x edition msource


(5) On DOS, OS/2 or UNIX systems, invoke the "msource" script to create
    the variant sources.  Four directories will be created:

    (i)   amsterdm     - replicating the Amsterdam print sources
    (ii)  dresden      - replicating the Dresden manuscript sources
    (iii) manchest     - replicating the Manchester part-books
    (iv)  turino       - replicating the Turin autographs

    Refer to the file "variants.txt" for detailed information concerning
    each of these sources.

NOTE: In recreating the various sources, the total disk requirements for the
      Vivaldi Twelve Violin Concertos will expand to roughly 4 megabytes.


The distribution disks include an executable program (called "edition")
that will allow users to access selected sources from the integrated
source files.

The "edition" command can only be used with the files contained on
DISK #2.

To install the "edition" command, ensure that the file "edition"
from DISK #2 was copied into the same directory as the one containing
the integrated source files for the Vivaldi Opus 8.

On UNIX systems, change the "file mode" so that the file "edition"
can be executed.  On UNIX systems, you can do this by executing the
following command:

   chmod a+x edition

On DOS or Windows systems running the MKS Toolkit, you can make this
file executable by renaming it as follows:

   mv edition edition.ksh

The "edition" command is now ready for execution.

==========
CHECKSUMS:
==========

     A "checksum" value is an error-checking mechanism that may assist
     in determining whether a file has been modified or data garbled
     due to transmission or faulty storage.  The "checksum A" value
     uses the POSIX.2 checksum algorithm.  The "checksum B" value uses
     the CCITT cyclic redundancy check algorithm.  Note that checksum
     commands differ from system to system.  The above checksums were
     calculated for DOS-format data.


============
ORGANIZATION
============

The collection of concertos is organized into two subdirectories:
(1) "seasons" contains the first four concertos comprising Vivaldi's
"Four Seasons"; (2) "others" contains the remaining eight violin
concertos (opus 8, Nos. 5 to 12).

All works are encoded in the Humdrum **kern format.  Refer to the accompanying
tutorial file ("kern_hlp.txt") for a detailed description of the **kern
representation.  All works consist of monophonic melodies.

RESEARCH NOTES

============================
USE OF THE "EDITION" COMMAND
============================

In order to use the "edition" command, you must have installed the
files on DISK #2.  (See "INSTALLATION" above.)
The "edition" command must be run from the directory containing the
Vivaldi Opus 8 files.  The command is invoked by specifying a single
option and a single filename.  The option letter is used to identify the
desired source.  The output file is automatically named by appending the
source designating letter to the filename.  For example, the command:

   edition -T op8n10c.krn

generates a file "op8n10ct.krn" containing the Turin version of Opus 8,
No. 10, third movement.  The -? option may be used to determine all
available versions for a given movement.  Not all sources are available
for all movements.

Syntax:

     edition -[DdTtMmSs?] Vivaldi_opus8_inputfile

Options:

     -D     : Generate output file encoding to Dresden manuscript.
     -d     : same as -D
     -T     : Generate output file encoding to Turin autograph.
     -t     : same as -T
     -M     : Generate output file encoding to Manchester part-books.
     -m     : same as -M
     -S     : Generate output file encoding to Selfridge-Field critical edition.
     -s     : same as -S
     -? file  : Identify all available sources/options for file "file"

In some case, additional options are provided for certain movements.  For
example the second movement of Opus 8, No. 8  ("op8n08b.krn") provides two
different versions of the Turin autograph:  the "original" script and a
later "revised" script overlayed by Vivaldi.  In this case, the -T option
produces the original Turin document, whereas the -R option generates the
later revisions introduced by Vivaldi.

Another anomaly is evident in the first movement of Opus 8, No. 10 
("op8n10b.krn").  This movement has a binary (A-B) form; repeats are marked
for both the A and B sections.  The "edition" command allows access to
three different repetition-expansions for each of two sources (Amsterdam
and Selfridge-Field).  No repeats are generated by default (i.e., -A or -S).
The A section can be repeated if there is a trailing lower-case "a" following
after the main option:  e.g.

   edition -Aa op08n10b.krn)

Both the A and B sections are repeated if the source option is followed by
the trailing "r."  For example,

   edition -Sr op08n10b.krn"

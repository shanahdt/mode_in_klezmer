Tom,

Thanks for writing.

Here's what I propose.  Below is a sample "template"
I'd like to pay you $2 per piece.  If you rustle-up
some big fake books, it should be possible to encode
a piece in as little as 5 minutes.

I'm looking for you to encode say 100 pop songs.

I recommend that you begin by encoding four or five pieces,
e-mail the encodings to me, and then we can meet to discuss
any possible problems before you continue encoding more.

Let me make a few comments on the sample encoding
given below.  The !!!COM: line is to encode the composer
(if you know who, otherwise omit).  The !!!MPN: line is
to encode the performer(s) (again omit if not pertinent).
The !!!OTL: line is to encode the song title.  The !!!YOR:
line is used to encode the author, title, imprint, and
page numbers of any source book you may use.  Try your
best for a key designation -- e.g. *G: for G major,
*a-: for A-flat minor.

If a song has several verses or chorus, please mark them
with comments.  Expand the encoding to match the typical
duration of the song.

Let me know if you have any questions.
You can phone me at 688-4753.

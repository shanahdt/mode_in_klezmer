NOTES:

1. The repeats between bars 33 and 40 in "notre24" have
   been expanded in this encoding.

2. In bar 59 of "notre18" the three notes in the second (upper)
   voice are probably a mistake in the manuscript.  They should
   probably be written down an octave in order to avoid the
   downward leap of a major ninth in bar 60.  Nevertheless,
   the bar in question has been encoded as written.

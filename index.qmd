title: "Modes in Klezmer Music: A Corpus Study Based on Beregovski's _Jewish Instrumental Folk Music_"
---

This website provides machine-readable music files, searchable metadata, mode analyses, and mode data for a corpus of klezmer tunes from the volume _Jewish Instrumental Folk Music_, compiled by the pre-eminent Ukrainian Jewish ethnomusicologist Moshe Beregovski (1892-1961). The website is intended as a self-standing resource for musicians and scholars and as a supplement to an article by Malin and Shanahan, currently in progress.

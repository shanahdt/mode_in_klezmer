title: "Modes in Klezmer Music: A Corpus Study Based on Beregovski's _Jewish Instrumental Folk Music_"
---

This site provides machine-readable music files, searchable metadata, mode analyses, and mode data for a corpus of klezmer tunes from the volume _Jewish Instrumental Folk Music_, compiled by the pre-eminent Ukrainian Jewish ethnomusicologist Moshe Beregovski (1892-1961). The volume was published posthumously, first in Russian (1987) and then in English (2001 and 2015). A hand-written manuscript of the volume is also available in Beregovski 2013. The tunes were collected from a variety of sources in Ukraine, in the decades before World War II, and the volume represents one of the most important sources for Jewish instrumental music from Eastern Europe, now known as klezmer (Slobin 1986, 253; Feldman 2016, 128).

The website is intended as a self-standing resource for musicians and scholars and as a supplement to an article by Malin and Shanahan, currently in progress.

# Corpora

Here, I have my corpora in one nice (private) spot, split into datasets that are either publically available (such as Essen and Barlow and Morgenstern instrumental data) and those that haven't really been released yet (such as the Raga Data, the Wikifonia Data, and the Barlow and Morgenstern Opera data.

Here, we have:

- The Charlie Parker Omnibook (Shanahan, Shanahan, and Baker)
- The Miles Davis Solos (Shanahan and Shanahan)
- The Clifford Brown Data (David Baker)
- The Dvorak Themes (Andrew Brinkman)
- The Complete Densmore Collection (Shanahan, Shanahan, Huron, Von Hippel, Sapp)
- The Barlow and Morgenstern Opera Data (Shanahan and Shanahan)
- Wikifonia (Shanahan, Sapp)
- The iRealB (Broze and Shanahan)
- The RISM Dataset
- The Josquin Research Project (Rodin and Sapp)
- The Meertens Tune Collection (Kranenburg, et al)
- Essen (Schaffrath)

## Best practices

Dude, don't make this a messy directory like all the other ones. Make sure your scripts call to these directories, but leave the actual data elsewhere in a project file.

In order to search for specific items, use quotation marks. For example, searching for C major will give you anything that has both C and major, but searching for "C major" will return results that are explicitly in C major.

```{r, echo=F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(DT)
df <- read.csv("data/beregovski-metadata.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
df <- df |> clean_names()
df <- df |>  select(!c(mode, modulation_pathway, modulation_measures, one_mode, mode_notes))
df |>          
    datatable(filter="top", rownames=FALSE)

## to-do
## make spacing of columns wider for the text.
## replace periods in column names with spaces.

```

There is a brief shift to D freygish (V) at the cadence in mm. 12–13, but we kept these bars with the rest of the section (criterion 1). Section C (mm. 14–25) identified as G minor based on the cadence (criteria 1 and 3).

We did not feel comfortable with Bb major (III) as the modal designation for the entire section; nor did we feel comfortable wiht C minor (iv) because it is undermined by the cadence. In this instance (and only in this instance), we an interpreted an individual section within the frame of the tune as a whole. Thus, we interpreted both C minor (iv) and Bb (III) as digressions within G minor. Sections A and C also include local moments emphasizing C minor and Bb major.

47	Skotshne	Minor	listening	Makonovetsky, A. E. 	transcription (Makonovetsky)	Violin	Khabno	-	-	Kiev	Khabno	D	Up P5	G major; G raised fourth	13–20; 20–27	no	Section A could be identified as G minor or G raised fourth. It is identified here in G minor for two reasons: (1) Measures 1–4 are more typical of G minor with an emphasis on G, repeated Bb–A–G descent, and no C#s. (2) Measures 5–8 shift clearly to G raised fourth with strong empahsis on C#; mm. 9–11 then shift back to material from the opening. The section as a whole is thus identified as G minor with G raised fourth as a digression (criterion 1).

49	Freylekhs	Minor	listening	Cherniavsky, B.	recording	Clarinet	Belaia Tserkov	1935	-	Kiev	Belaia Tserkov	G	-		All minor	yes	Section C could be identified as G minor based on the first five bars (mm. 21–25) or Bb major based on the cadence (mm. 26–28). The section is identified as G minor since the majority of the material implies G minor. Criterion 3 does not apply here since the cadence is not in the primary mode.

The section focuses on the upper G for a whole, but this is a common move in the raised fourth move. Section A and B both include brief moments of C minor (iv) before the cadentce (mm. 12–13 and 31–32). These are treated as local moves within the mode. Beregovski also notes that C natural occasionally alternates with C# in the raised fourth mode (1982, 551). Compare with no. 184.

Section C (mm. 18–25), however, focuses more on this upper range and extends at a key moment down to C. We have therefore identified it as C raised fourth. Horowitz (1993, 20–23) identifies the mode of this section as C raised fourth, while also noting that it could be analyzed as D freygish.

A Bb major cadence is plausible at the end of the section. The section as a whole is still designated as G minor based on the prominence of G at the phrase beginings and end of the first phrase (m. 4) (criterion 1). This section does not fit other criteria (2, 3, or 4) for designating modulations wthin sections. Compare with no. 230.

This does not strictly fit criterion 2 (documenting shifts at cadences when there is a return to a primary mode) because the primary mode is not freygish. It is similar, however, to many other instances that shift to freygish at the cadence, and so it is included with them.

The section cadences on G, however, which could be interpreted as the dominant of C minor and also leads back into G freygish. The section as a whole is designated as C minor (criterion 1).

# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website provides machine-readable music files, searchable metadata, mode analyses, and mode data for a corpus of klezmer tunes from the volume _Jewish Instrumental Folk Music_, compiled by the pre-eminent Ukrainian Jewish ethnomusicologist Moshe Beregovski (1892-1961). The website is intended as a self-standing resource for musicians and scholars and as a supplement to an article by [Authors Names Redacted], currently in progress.

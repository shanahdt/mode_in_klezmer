## The Link to the Corpus 

The full corpus can be found on our [public github site](https://github.com/shanahdt/mode_in_klezmer). Specifically, the full corpus will all of the kern files and the excerpts broken down into sections, can be found [here](https://github.com/shanahdt/mode_in_klezmer/tree/main/corpus). 


## How the corpus was assembled.

The dataset is collected from the Beregovski's transcriptions (see [the introduction page](introduction.qmd) for a description of this). This was then encoded into Sibelius by Yonatan Malin, and converted into the **kern format by Daniel Shanahan. More information can be found on the introduction page, and in publications.

The corpus was digitized from the second English edition by Research Assistants Rebecca Hamel and Izzy Fincher with funding from the Center for Humanities & the Arts and Program in Jewish Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. Research Assistant Laine Gruver assisted with data entry for the website.

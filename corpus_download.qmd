## How the corpus was assembled.

The dataset is collected from Beregovski’s _Jewish Instrumental Folk Music_ (see [the introduction page](introduction.qmd) for a description of this). The corpus was digitized from the second English edition by Research Assistants Rebecca Hamel and Izzy Fincher with funding from the Center for Humanities & the Arts and Program in Jewish Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. Daniel Shanahan converted xml files to the **kern format. Research Assistant Laine Gruver assisted with data entry for the website.

More information can be found on the introduction page.
